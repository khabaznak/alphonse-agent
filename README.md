# Atrium Server

Atrium is a self-hosted domestic infrastructure designed to host **Rex**,
a resident digital butler that is proactive, educational, and protective.

Atrium is not a smart-home gadget, nor a generic assistant.
It is the persistent environment in which Rex exists, observes, learns, and serves.

---

## What is Rex?

Rex is the resident butler of Atrium.

Rex:
- observes household state without intruding,
- provides context before advice,
- educates through opportunity,
- protects by detecting anomalies, not by enforcing behavior.

Rex is governed by an explicit constitution that defines his role, limits, tone,
and ethical orientation.

---

## What Atrium Is

Atrium is:

- a **local-first** system
- designed to be **self-hosted**
- owned and controlled by the household
- extensible through multiple interfaces (apps, voice, services)
- built to evolve gradually and deliberately

Atrium prioritizes trust, clarity, and restraint over automation volume.

---

## What Atrium Is Not

Atrium is not:

- a cloud-dependent assistant
- a surveillance system
- a command-and-control AI
- a replacement for human judgment

---

## Repository Structure

This repository hosts the **Atrium Server**, the core environment where Rex lives.

Key files:

- `CONSTITUTION.md` — Rex’s founding charter and behavioral contract
- `README.md` — This document
- `docs/` — Design notes, vision, and long-term ideas

Code will be introduced incrementally once identity and boundaries are clearly defined.

---

## Status

This project is in its foundational phase.

The current focus is:
- defining identity,
- establishing ethical and behavioral constraints,
- and creating a stable base for future capabilities.

---

## Philosophy

Atrium is built with the belief that:

> A system that knows when to remain silent
> is more intelligent than one that speaks constantly.

---

## License

License to be defined.
