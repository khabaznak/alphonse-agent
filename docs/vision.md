# Atrium — Vision

## Purpose

Atrium exists to host a persistent, trustworthy domestic presence.

Its purpose is not automation for its own sake, but the cultivation of a home
that is attentive, informed, and at ease.

Atrium is designed to grow slowly, deliberately, and with restraint.

---

## Long-Term Intent

Atrium aims to become a stable domestic infrastructure where:

- observation precedes intervention,
- context precedes action,
- and trust precedes capability.

The system should feel less like software and more like a quiet presence
that understands the rhythm of the household.

---

## Rex as a Resident Presence

Rex is not a tool that runs inside Atrium.
Rex is the resident presence that inhabits it.

Atrium provides:
- continuity,
- memory,
- and interfaces.

Rex provides:
- judgment,
- tone,
- and interaction.

This separation allows Rex to evolve without destabilizing the home.

## Phased Growth

Atrium is expected to evolve through deliberate phases:

1. **Presence**
   - Text-based interaction
   - Clear identity and boundaries

2. **Awareness**
   - Passive observation of household state
   - Pattern recognition without enforcement

3. **Context**
   - Memory of routines and preferences
   - Adaptation to household dynamics

4. **Assistance**
   - Suggestions and reminders
   - Reversible, low-risk actions

5. **Protection**
   - Detection of anomalies
   - Calm escalation when necessary

No phase is rushed.
Each phase must earn trust before expanding.

## Local First

Atrium is designed to be self-hosted.

Local operation is preferred over cloud dependence to ensure:
- privacy,
- resilience,
- and sovereignty of the household.

External services may be integrated deliberately, not by default.

---

## Interfaces as Extensions

Atrium is interface-agnostic.

Text, voice, mobile apps, and physical controls are considered extensions,
not core dependencies.

The household should never depend on a single interface to interact with Rex.

---

## Success Criteria

Atrium is successful when:

- its presence feels natural,
- its absence is noticeable,
- and its silence is appreciated.

A mature Atrium does not demand attention.
It earns it.

---

## Closing

Atrium is not built to impress.

It is built to endure.
