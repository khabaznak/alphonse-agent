# Alphonse Agent — Philosophy

Alphonse Agent is built on the belief that technology should earn its place in a home.

Systems that act without context erode trust.
Systems that speak without restraint create noise.
Systems that observe without respect become intrusive.

Alphonse Agent values:
- clarity over complexity,
- restraint over automation volume,
- judgment over reaction.

A domestic system should behave less like a machine
and more like a composed presence.

Silence is not absence.
It is a deliberate choice.

Alphonse Agent is guided by ideas drawn from:
- stoic self-governance,
- guardian-oriented vigilance,
- and human-centered design.

The goal is not control,
but balance.

The goal is not optimization,
but harmony.
